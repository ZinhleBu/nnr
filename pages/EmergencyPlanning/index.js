            <h1>Emergency Planning & Preparedness</h1>
<br />
            <p>A key component of the mission of the NNR is to ensure adequate protective actions are in place to protect the health and safety of the public. Protective actions are taken to avoid or reduce radiation dose and are sometimes referred to as protective measures. Operators of nuclear facilities are required to develop and maintain effective emergency plans and procedures. The NNR inspects licensees to ensure that they are prepared to deal with emergencies.</p>
            <p>The overall objective of Emergency Preparedness (EP) is to ensure that the nuclear power plant operator is capable of implementing adequate measures to protect public health and safety in the event of a radiological emergency. As a condition of their license, nuclear installation licensees must develop and maintain EP plans that meet comprehensive NNR EP requirements. Increased confidence in public protection is obtained through the combined inspection of the requirements of emergency preparedness and the evaluation of their implementation.</p>
            <p>The NNR maintains oversight of the capability of nuclear installation licensees to protect the public by conducting thorough inspections and it also assesses the capabilities of the licensees to protect the public by conducting full-scale exercises at least once every two years which includes the participation of government agencies and relevant roleplayers. These exercises are performed in order to maintain the skills of the emergency responders and to identify and correct weaknesses. The NNR also participates in periodic emergency drills which are conducted by the licensees.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Public Awareness about Emergency Preparedness</h2>
            <p>The NNR requires nuclear installation licensees to establish a public safety information forum for the purposes of sharing information on nuclear safety and emergency preparedness with members of the public. For this reason the Koeberg nuclear power station and the Necsa Pelindaba and Vaalputs sites convenes quarterly forums qhihc are attended by members of the public, the NNR and relevant roleplayers involved with emergency planning and response. The NNR hosts a VIP Observer programme which is attended by representatives from key stakeholder groups including civil society.</p>
